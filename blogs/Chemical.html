<center><h1>Chemical Kinetics</h1></center>

So this is my first blog so don't judge me. I will post the blogs on stuff, I learned daily as it is today I studied a bit of chemistry(I hate chemistry btw) to be more precise Chemical Kinetics.<br>

So what is it?<br>

It's a branch of chemistry that deals with the speed of the chemical reactions at least that's how I understand this.<br>

There is the term rate of reaction which could be defined as the change in the molar concentration of a reactant or product per unit time or increase/decrease in molar concentration of reaction per unit time.
It can be matematically be represented as:<br> 
<br>
				<center>-▲R/ ▲t = ▲P/▲t</center>
<br>
For a reaction <br>
				 <center>R ---> P</center>

We can simply represent as:<br>
		<center>Rate of Reaction = Change in molar concentation/Time taken</center>
<br>
The rate of reaction is divided into two categories<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Average rate of reaction: Change in molar concentration of R or P(Reference from above example) in a given interval of time.</li>
<br>
<li>Instantaneous rate of reaction: Change in molar concentration of R or P(Reference from above example) at a given instant of time.</li>
</ul>
It is differentiated by delta(▲) and d<br>
<br>
For example:<br> 
			<centre>aA + bB -----> cC</centre><br>
For average : <br>
	<br>
	<center>-1/a ▲[A]/▲t = -1/b ▲[B]/▲t = 1/ c ▲[C]/▲t</center>
<br>
For Instantaneous: <br>
	<br>
	<center>-1/a d[A]/dt = -1/b d[B]/dt = 1/ c d[C]/dt</center>
<br>
Now we can talk about factor which affects the rate of reaction<br>
<ul>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Catalyst</li>
<li>Physical state of the reactant</li>
<li>Sunlight</li>
<li>Concentration of reaction</li>
<li>Surface area of the reactant</li>
</ul>
<br>
Now its time to discuss <b>Rate Law</b><br>
<br>
According to <b>Rate Law</b> rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of the molar concentration of reactant each raises to the power their actual used concentration term on which rate of reaction depends.<br>
<br>
Mathematically it can be written as: 
<br>
	<center>Rate of reaction ∝ [A]<sup>α</sup>> [B]<sup>ß</sup></center>
<br>
For the chemical reaction:<br> 
	<br>
	<center>aA+ bB  -----> Product</center>
<br>
<br>
Proportionality sign can be removed by introducing a constant which we call <b>Rate constant or Specific reaction rate</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now the order of reaction can be defined by the sum of powers on which rate of reaction depends according to rate law expression.<br>
<br>
<br>There is more stuff but let's wrap it up we will continue some other time.<br>
