<h1>Discord Bots</h1>
</center>
<p>So yesterday I was pretty bored and looking for some projects as I'm improving my C (the programming language) but end up contributing to GitHub repos and then I thought about creating a discord bot and used python for it (because javascript is gay) and it pretty easy like a beginner can code it, let be clear I am talking about the basic bot, not complex ones. I created RickSanchez big fan of Rick and Morty BTW, so my idea is pretty simple. I put some famous quotes of him in a text file and if someone messages on the discord server it will search for the keywords from rick quotes and if it matches it will push the message into the server. The whole point of writing this blog is if you have your discord server. I would highly recommend you to write your bots for simple tasks. I am not criticising any bots some of them are good and if you don't have time that alright but it will be a great learning process for a beginner to get a good idea of API's and how to work with python packages. Keep learning</p>
